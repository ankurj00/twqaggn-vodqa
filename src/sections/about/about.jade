    p Heuristic (from the Greek "heuriskein" meaning "to discover") pertains to the process of gaining knowledge or some desired result by intelligent guesswork rather than by following some pre-established formula. Testing Heuristics is a fallible method of solving a problem. Excellent testing requires skill, but heuristics give structure to that skill. They do not replace skill and they donâ€™t make skill unnecessary. But they can make skilled people more productive and reliable.

HICCUPPS and SFDPOT are the examples of mnemonics that help in Heuristic Testing. If you have any interesting insights that you would like to present, submit your talk in the below form.
